# HealthCare-Providers-Dashboard
This project features a comprehensive Healthcare Provider Dashboard developed using Power BI. The main goal of this dashboard is to present important financial and operational insights related to healthcare billing, treatment expenses, and patient services in a visual and user-friendly format.

**Dashboard Overview:**
This dashboard offers a clear and interactive view of key healthcare financial metrics, making complex data easier to understand and act on.

**Financial Snapshot:**
At a glance, users can see major figures like total billing (£3.4M), treatment expenses (£3M), medication costs (£546K), insurance claims (£2.2M), patient-paid amounts (£1.1M), and room charges (£180K). It gives a complete picture of the financial flow.

**Geographic Insights:**
Users can explore billing patterns across cities and states using a dynamic map. This helps identify where most of the healthcare spending is happening and spot regional trends.

**Procedures & Departments:**
The dashboard breaks down how much is spent on common procedures such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. It also highlights how costs are distributed across departments like Cardiology, Orthopedics, Neurology, and General Medicine.

**Conditions & Service Types:**
Understand how spending varies by health conditions—like hypertension, asthma, and migraine—and by service categories such as emergency care, inpatient services, and outpatient visits.
